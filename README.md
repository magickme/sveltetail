# sveltetail
Bash script to initialize a new SvelteKit app with Tailwind CSS preinstalled.

## instructions

Clone a new Github repo to local and then run the shell script from inside it. Make sure the cloned repo has the name you want to use for your new app.

You'll still need to edit the various config files as listed at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit, because I'm too lazy to add sed commands right now. 

Happy Svelting!
