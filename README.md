# sveltetail
Bash script to initialize a new SvelteKit app with Tailwind CSS preinstalled.

## instructions

Download the shell script and run
```
chmod +x sveltetail.sh
```
If you're doing a lot of dev work with SvelteKit, keep it around in your local code folder and copy it into new projects whenever you make one.

Clone a new Github repo to local and then run the shell script from inside it. Make sure the cloned repo has the name you want to use for your new app.

Happy Svelting!
